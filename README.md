# React Video Editor

A React-based video editor designed to provide essential video editing features with a user-friendly interface. This project was developed as part of an Upwork contract; however, the client refused to pay upon initial delivery. While the project includes a functional base, critical features are yet to be implemented for full usability.

## Features Implemented

* Basic Video Editing Capabilities:
    * Video upload and preview.
    * Basic trimming and cutting functionality.
    * Text overlay support.

## Work To Be Done

Despite the progress so far, several essential features are pending:

* Remotion Player Composition on the Server
    * Implement server-side rendering and composition of video using Remotion.
    * This will allow rendering dynamic video compositions programmatically.
* Whisper Model Integration
    * Integrate OpenAI's Whisper model for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
    * This feature will enable automatic transcription of audio in uploaded videos.
* Additional Enhancements
    * Improve the export process with multiple format and resolution support.
    * Refine the user interface and enhance the overall user experience.
